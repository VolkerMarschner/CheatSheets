- Use when: Need to process large datasets in memory

### X instances
- Lowest price per GiB of RAM
- Best for: SAP HANA, Apache Spark, big data processing
- Features: Very large memory sizes (up to several TiB)
- Examples: x1, x2gd
- Use when: Need extreme memory capacity

### Z instances
- Highest memory capacity
- Best for: Large in-memory databases, big data processing
- Features: Up to 24TB of memory
- Examples: z1d

## Key Considerations When Choosing Instance Types

1. **Performance Requirements**
   - CPU utilization patterns
   - Memory needs
   - Storage IOPS requirements
   - Network performance needs

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - On-demand vs. Reserved vs. Spot instances
   - Right-sizing based on utilization
   - Auto-scaling requirements

3. **Workload Patterns**
   - Consistent vs. variable loads
   - Batch vs. real-time processing
   - Development vs. production environments

4. **Compatibility**
   - Operating system support
   - Application architecture
   - Hardware requirements (x86 vs. ARM)

5. **Regional Availability**
   - Not all instance types available in all regions
   - Newer generations may have limited availability
